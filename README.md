# Titanic dataset

On this dataset I am trying to:
Importation of libraries and load the dataset.

Create a bar plot to visualize the number of passengers who survived and did not survive, broken down by gender.

Create a histogram to display the distribution of passengers' ages. Use different colors for passengers who survived and did not survive.

Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of fare prices paid by passengers, broken down by their class (1st, 2nd, and 3rd class).

Generate a scatter plot to explore the relationship between passengers' ages and fare prices, using different colors and symbols for the different classes.

Use faceting to create a scatter plot matrix displaying the relationship between age, fare, and class for passengers who survived and did not survive.

Export your final visualizations as HTML files to share with others.
